## Introduction

This innovative tool bridges the gap between traditional pen-and-paper assessments and digital grading systems, offering a seamless and efficient solution for 
evaluating handwritten assignments. Handwritten Essay Marking Software employs cutting-edge optical character recognition (OCR) and machine learning algorithms to
convert handwritten text into digital format, enabling educators to assess and provide feedback on essays electronically. This revolutionary approach not only 
streamlines the grading process but also enhances accuracy, consistency, and accessibility in evaluation.

## Problem

Traditional manual marking is a time-consuming and labor-intensive process, often leading to inefficiencies in grading. Educators spend significant amounts of time
reviewing and evaluating each student's essay, which can be impractical and burdensome. Also, grading is often influenced by the mood or biases of the marker, 
leading to inconsistencies in evaluation. Moreover, as the class size increases, the task becomes more challenging and time-consuming for educators.
